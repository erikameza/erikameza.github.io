        1. Find and choose one of our licenced Agents
    </h3>
    <p>There are many ways to find a realtor in California. To save the most time and money, stick to sources that make
        it easy to find quality options.
    </p>
    <h3 id="listing-agreement">2. Sign a California listing agreement and seller disclosures</h3>
    <p>After meeting with agents and deciding on your top pick, it’s time to read and sign a California listing agreement to get your house on the market.</p>
    <p>Here you’ll find important details of your home sale. It contains your anticipated listing date, initial list price, what’s included (or not included) in your sale, where the listing will be marketed, and the length of your agreement.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Key things to pay attention to include:&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Type of listing agreement</strong>. Most agents work under an <a href="https://www.realestatewitch.com/exclusive-right-to-sell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive right to sell listing agreement</a> (single agency). It means the agent works solely for you and gets paid regardless of whether they bring forward a buyer or not.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>Listing commission rate. </strong>Make sure the agent’s stated commission rate matches up to what’s on the listing agreement.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>Items that convey with the property</strong>. If you plan to keep items or belongings in the home like appliances, you’ll need to write that down in the contract.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Realtor disclosure requirements</h4>
    <p>California law requires agents to provide you with an agency disclosure form, which describes all of the agent’s legal duties to you.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Here are the types of real estate agency agreements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Single agent relationship</strong>.<strong> </strong>The agent or broker represents only one party (either the buyer or seller) and acts as a fiduciary. Agents often recommend their clients work under a single agent relationship – it gives their clients the most protection compared to other options.</li>
        <li><strong>Transaction broker relationship or “open listing</strong>.” The agent or broker provides limited representation to a buyer, seller, or both parties in a transaction, and does not act as a fiduciary (meaning they don’t have to act in your best interests). It’s a less desirable option compared to a single agent relationship since the agent doesn’t have to act in your best interests (not a fiduciary).</li>
        <li><strong>Dual agency</strong>. The agent can represent both you and the buyer in the same transaction while also acting as a fiduciary for both parties. This might happen if your listing agent brings a buyer to the table. Although it’s illegal in some states, <a href="https://www.stimmel-law.com/en/articles/dual-agency-and-real-estate-brokers-needs-full-disclosure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dual agency</a> is legal and quite common in California.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Contact a local real estate attorney for more advice on California<strong> </strong>listing agreements and required disclosures.</p>
    <h4>What do California sellers need to disclose to buyers?</h4>
    <p>California disclosure requirements are complicated compared to most other states.<strong> </strong></p>
    <p>Sellers are legally required to complete the <a href="https://www.car.org/-/media/CAR/Documents/Transaction-Center/PDF/Standard-Forms/2020-June-Final/TDS-VERSION-1-REDLINE-(1).pdf?la=en&amp;hash=D42DDF11D099FB7A7ED0A9D5F74950C4781C44F8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Real Estate Transfer Disclosure Statement</a> and provide it to the buyer as soon as possible before transferring the title.</p>
    <p>Sellers must still notify buyers about any defects that may affect the value of the home or the buyer’s readiness to purchase it. These include structural defects, any structural additions to the property (e.g. new bedrooms), flooding problems, or major weather-related damage to the property. Provide an explanation for each “Yes” answer.</p>
    <p>In California, sellers need to disclose material defects on a property before executing a sales contract. And sellers must also disclose if there was a death on the property if it occurred within the last three years (and was not AIDS-related). </p>

        </ul>
        <p>Ask your real estate attorney or agent about what they recommend you disclose to home buyers, and how to do so.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 id="price-home">3. Price your home</h3>
        <p>Your next step is to determine a competitive listing price for your home.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Home value estimators can provide you with a quick ballpark estimate of your home’s potential value, based on your property’s key features, recent home sales, active listings, neighborhood data, and local market trends.</p>
        <p>For a more accurate home value, speak with a local realtor. </p>
